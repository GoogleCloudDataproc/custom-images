# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we
have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement
(CLA).

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA]
    (https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA]
    (https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to
accept your pull requests.

## Coding Practices
1. [Write small PRs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests#write-small-prs), this helps reviewers to provide feedback and reason why something is changed. 
1. [Provide context and guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests#provide-context-and-guidance) in the title/description.
1. Squash commit messages into final one while merging to remove intermediate changes, to keep commit history clean.
1. Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style in the sample to which you are contributing. Shell scripts should follow the [Google shell style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml).
1. Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit/integration tests which all pass.
